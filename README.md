#Single-Shot MultiBox Detector implementation in Keras


As primary sourse was used: [SSD: Single-Shot MultiBox Detector implementation in Keras](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras#ssd-single-shot-multibox-detector-implementation-in-keras)

This is a Keras implementation of the SSD model ar{chitecture introduced by Wei Liu et al. in the paper [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).

All approach of model learning and data processing is represented in
